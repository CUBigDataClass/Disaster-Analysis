# Real-time disaster analysis using Twitter ( Frontend )

Since the backend is based on BSON ( Binary JSON ) and the language used to communicate with the backend is python ( Apache Spark ), it would be good to have a server based on python / javascript as well. Since python functions can be called easily if the framework is based on python, prefer to use Python Flask. To make it easier, plan is to use AngularJS in future on the frontend (client side) where as use python for the server.
